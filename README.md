# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview
This exercise takes employee and department data from a large and aging company. The data is stored and queried in PostgreSQL to filter the data into specific tables. The goal is to determine which employees are close to retirement and who is eligible to replace them.

## Results
The company has about 20% of it's workforce, many in management, who are about to retire (based on age). Only 1% of its workforce is eligible for the mentorship program, meaning this company needs to start recruiting to avoid a major crisis as most of their experienced employees leave.
